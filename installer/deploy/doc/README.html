Meandre Workbench is a visual programming environment that allows users to easily connect software components together in a unique data flow environment. This application relies on the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and is accessed via your Internet browser. You can use this interface to develop diagrams of data operations relevant to your research. Each operation is represented by an icon, and the icons are linked together in a flow representing the movement of data through each operation. Each of these icons represents a component. These software components are reusable components that facilitate collaboration among developers. These components can be written in Java, Python, or Lisp. A set of components can be loaded into your Workbench for creating a flow (application).
Flows are essentially applications composed of components connected together. Flow complexity is limited only by the needs of your project. Pre-built flows can be loaded into the Workbench and modified as needed. A number of flows for use in a variety of data mining problems and domains have been developed and can be added to your Workbench.
Components and flows have tags and additional metadata associated with them that can be used to assist in searching and sorting.
